<p style="text-align:center">Throughout my diploma studies at UiTM Machang, I have learned many things. <br>For example learning to communicate with people and learning to manage an organization.<br> many obstacles that I successfully faced in order to shoulder the responsibilities that have been entrusted to me.<br> most people do not know the scope of our work as people who take care of the welfare of students but many also understand our work.<br> being an active person in the organization is not something easy, it is very challenging physically and mentally. <br>these are some pictures of me going through the program while in the organization.</p>
